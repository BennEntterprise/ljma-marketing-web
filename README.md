# Laura Jean Music Academy

LJMA is a business which helps students, who are seriously focused on music performance, obtain private lessons. Those who work with LJMA often are featured in Squad Harmonix Groups (Performance, Seniors, Juniors).

# About the Project

The front end is built using React, scaffolded from the Create-React-App utility with a typescript template and NOT yet ejected. The backend is written on Node/Express.js (without typescript). Currently this is a marketing/presentation site and so the express server is very slim with only the routes required to serve the static files. Once the MVP is launched (which requires minimal backend code) the backend will be converted to typescript and re-released.

Additionally you should be familiar with the Bootstrap Layout Scheme as it is implemented via the React-Bootstrap abstraction.
